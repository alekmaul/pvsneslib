# What is PVSnesLib ?

![PVSnesLib](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2528347/198873675-57a9670a-3ef2-4fc9-a5b0-e2e9fcf62cc6.png)

PVSnesLib is an open and free library to develop programs for the Nintendo SNES using the C programming language.

Created initially for the 20th birthday of the Nintendo SNES, it has been evolved a lot and is now mainly coded in assembler for performances reasons. It is also directly usable in asm for those who do not want to use C language but without rewriting everything from scratch.

PVSneslib content is split in 3 parts
* The library itself.
* The tools and compiler (compatible on Windows and Linux operating systems but for **32 bits only**)
* The examples (sprites, sound, graphics, debug, ...)

You can download the complete archive in [release section](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib/releases) then check the Wiki sections to get installation instructions and basics tutorials.
