------------------------------------------------------------------------------


v9.4 (03-Nov-2006) [ALL] Enhanced the documentation.
                   [ALL] .DEFINE without a definition value would make
                     WLA count the linenumbers afterwards wrong.
                   [Z80] If a pending computation follows "JR" or "DJNZ",
                     all the label references inside are relative.
                   [GB ] If a pending computation follows "JR",
                     all the label references inside are relative.
                   [65?] If a pending computation follows "BCC", "BCS", "BEQ",
                     "BMI", "BNE", "BPL", BVC", "BVS", all the label
                     references inside are relative.
                   [65C] If a pending computation follows "BCC", "BCS", "BEQ",
                     "BMI", "BNE", "BPL", BVC", "BVS", "BRA", "BBR*", "BBS*",
                     all the label references inside are relative.
                   [658] If a pending computation follows "BCC", "BCS", "BEQ",
                     "BMI", "BNE", "BPL", BVC", "BVS", "BRA", "BRL", "PER",
                     all the label references inside are relative.
                   [HuC] If a pending computation follows "BCC", "BCS", "BEQ",
                     "BMI", "BNE", "BPL", BVC", "BVS", "BSR", "BBR*", "BBS*",
                     "BRA", all the label references inside are relative.
                   [SPC] If a pending computation follows "BCC", "BCS", "BEQ",
                     "BMI", "BNE", "BPL", BVC", "BVS", "BRA", "BBS", "BBC",
                     "CBNE *", "DBNZ *", all the label references inside
                     are relative.

v9.3 (09-Sep-2006) [ALL] Updated makefiles (by Tobias Pflug).
                   [ALL] Added 'memorymaps' directory, where you can find
                     default .MEMORYMAPs for various target machines.
                   [ALL] Enhanced .MEMORYMAP defining.
                   [ALL] Added .ASCIITABLE (.ASCTABLE) and .ASC.
                   [ALL] .DEFINE works also without a definition value
                     (defaults to 0).
                   [ALL] Added .BLOCK and .ENDB.
                   [ALL] Added .SYM (and alias .SYMBOL).

                   [ALL] Added .SHIFT.
                   [ALL] Relaxed the MACRO argument counting. Any MACRO can now
                     be called with varying number of arguments.
                   [ALL] .DEFINE can now handle definitions where lone address
                     labels appear (e.g., only "MAIN+0" used to work).
                   [ALL] Added AmigaOS4 makefiles (by Ventzislav Tzvetkov).
                   [ALL] Some code cleanups.

                     describing the dependencies of the main source file.
                   [ALL] Added flag 'q' to suppress .PRINT* -directives.
                   [ALL] Hexadecimal values can now be given using
                     the suffix 'h' (e.g., 10h and 0abh).
                   [ALL] Fixed the preprocessor to handle cases like "-: jr -".
                   [ALL] Sections did affect the .ORG outside of them,
                     in some special cases.
                   [ALL] Added "RETURNORG" to .SECTION to (hopefully) fix
                     this thing once and for all.

v9.1 (26-Jun-2004) [ALL] Sections do not affect the .ORG outside of them.
                   [ALL] Code cleanups.
                   [ALL] .IFs can compare string definitions.

                   [ALL] Added aliases .DEF (.DEFINE), .REDEF (.REDEFINE),
                     .UNDEF (.UNDEFINE), .WORD (.DW), .BYT (.DB), .BYTE (.DB),
                     .ASC (.DB), .EQU (.DEFINE) and .REPEAT (.REPT).
                   [ALL] Added .FOPEN, .FCLOSE, .FREAD and .FSIZE.
                   [ALL] Increased the case insensitivity in many directives.
                   [ALL] It's possible to use "=" in .DEFINE and .REDEFINE.
                   [ALL] The initial size of a section can now be given with
                     the keyword "SIZE" (take a look at the README).
                   [ALL] .FAIL exits nicer.
                   [ALL] .ENUM can do descending enumeration.
                   [ALL] Added operators '>' (get the high byte) and '<'
                     (get the low byte).
                   [ALL] FREE, SEMIFREE and SUPERFREE sections can be aligned.
                   [ALL] Added "FSIZE" to .INCBIN.

                   [ALL] Structure members can now be used in computations.
                   [ALL] Relaxed the handling of '.' in stack calculator. Now
                     for example "AND1 C,1+2+3.3-2-1" works (SPC-700).
                   [Z80] Fixed opcodes in group 7 to work again. A new feature
                     in 9.0 broke these.
                   [658] .SNESHEADER, .SNESNATIVEVECTOR and .SNESEMUVECTOR
                     don't work with libraries any more.
                   [658] .SNESNATIVEVECTOR and .SNESEMUVECTOR don't change
                     .ORG anymore.
                   [658] All the vectors of .SNESNATIVEVECTOR and
                     .SNESEMUVECTOR are optional and default to $0000.
                   [658] Added .SMC, .INDEX and .ACCU.
                   [658] Operand hinting overrides SEP/REP/.INDEX/.ACCU when
                     dealing with immediate value opcodes (now when did this
                     break?), and .8BIT/.16BIT/.24BIT affect only the rest of
                     the opcodes. WARNING! Check your code as this fix may
                     break it.
                   [658] "LDY.W #?" works now.
                   [658] Added 24bit operand hint .l.
                   [65x] Added more operand size checks to opcode parsers.

v9.0 (23-Nov-2003) [ALL] The number of arguments macros take is not limited
                     anymore.
                   [ALL] It is possible to give names to the macro arguments.
                   [ALL] A loose .ENDR gives now a proper error message.
                   [ALL] Trying to define reserved definition labels
                     (like "NARGS") will give an error.
                   [ALL] Stack calculator can now return floating point
                     values (.D*(SIN/COS) do not round the arguments
                     any more).
                   [ALL] WLA defaults to BANK 0 SLOT 0 ORG 0 at startup.
                   [ALL] Added .SLOT.
                   [ALL] .INCDIR, .INCLUDE and .INCBIN try to convert the
                     directory paths to the host operating system's syntax.
                   [ALL] WLA compiles now "WLAT" library files and "WLAH"
                     object files.
                   [ALL] It is possible to use floating point numbers in
                     all computations.
                   [ALL] It is possible to export floating point definitions.
                   [ALL] All computation values passed to WLALINK are now
                     in double format.
                   [ALL] Fixed a possible error when dealing with multivalue
                     definitions.
                   [ALL] .REDEFINE handles all the same definition types as
                     .DEFINE.
                   [ALL] Many opcodes, which take signed arguments, do not
                     let the user to specify too large values (e.g., -1 cannot
                     be given as $FF any more).
                   [658] Fixed opcodes "MVN" and "MVP".
                   [GB ] It is possible to give "LD HL,(SP-n)" instead of
                     only "LD HL,(SP+n)".
                   [Z80] The minor version number in SDSCTAG should now work
                     properly.
                   [Z80] It is possible to give e.g., "LD A,(IX-1)" (only
                     "LD A,(IX+-1)" used to work).

v8.9 (12-Jun-2003) [ALL] Added .SEED, .DBRND and .DWRND.
                   [ALL] Added lowercase versions of run-time definitions
                     WLA_TIME, WLA_FILENAME, WLA_VERSION and NARGS.
                   [ALL] Added support for lowercase versions of the
                     following symbols and directives: DEFAULTSLOT,
                     SLOTSIZE, SLOT, .ENDME, .ENDRO, BANKSTOTAL, BANKS,
                     BANKSIZE, .ASM and .ENDASM.
                   [ALL] WLA compiles now "WLAS" library files and "WLAG"
                     object files.
                   [ALL] Used Valgrind to locate memory allocated from the
                     heap that WLA didn't free at exit (good for Amiga users).
                   [ALL] Fixed few error messages to show the address in
                     hexadecimal format instead of decimal.
                   [ALL] Added support for computation definitions.

                   [ALL] Added SUPERFREE sections.
                   [ALL] Macros can now pass their arguments directly to
                     other macros, and passing a computation to a macro
                     doesn't mess up things any more.
                   [ALL] The macros can now take only at max. 16 arguments.
                   [ALL] WLA doesn't crash when it tries to find the correct
                     mnemonic and has to free the very first computation stack.
                   [658] Added .COMPUTESNESCHECKSUM.
                   [658] Renamed "TBR" instructions to "TRB".
                   [658] $94 was defined as "STY x,Y". Fixed to "STY x,X".

                     .ENDEMUVECTOR.
                   [658] .BASE can now be given before the first .ORG.
                   [658] WLA now automatically sets the 65816 bit in
                     object files. Previously only SNES directives would
                     enable the WLA to do this.
                   [658] .HIROM and .LOROM now override the user's ROM
                     bank map when computing the 24bit addresses and bank
                     references.
                   [GB ] Renamed .COMPUTECHECKSUM to .COMPUTEGBCHECKSUM
                     (.COMPUTECHECKSUM is still recognized, though).
                   [GB ] Renamed .COMPUTECOMPLEMENTCHECK to
                     .COMPUTEGBCOMPLEMENTCHECK (.COMPUTECOMPLEMENTCHECK is
                     still recognized, though).
                   [HuC] Fixed the "TST" instruction (swapped $93 and $A3).

v8.8 (25-Feb-2003) [65c] "DEA" assembled to $3a, $00. Removed the extra $00.
                   [65c] Added "PHP" ($08) and "PLP" ($28).
                   [65c] Badly placed "RTS" and "RTI" broke the opcode table
                     so sorted the opcodes better this time.
                   [HuC] "DEA" assembled to $3a, $00. Removed the extra $00.
                   [HuC] Added "PHP" ($08) and "PLP" ($28).
                   [HuC] Badly placed "RTS" and "RTI" broke the opcode table
                     so sorted the opcodes better this time.
                   [SPC] Fixed the byte ordering (to test first, branch label
                     next) in "CBNE" ($2E and $DE) and "DBNZ" ($6E).
                   [SPC] "ASL !?" was defined as $CC, fixed to $0C.
                   [ALL] Decimal number parser didn't work with all cases
                     when a dot was encountered.
                   [ALL] Added support for longer filenames (> 63 characters).
                   [ALL] A correctly, but partially written mnemonic would
                     cause WLA to break the compiling, but without giving
                     an error message.
                   [ALL] Fixed a rare bug which caused WLA and WLALINK to
                     disagree on section id numbers.
                   [ALL] WLA compiles now "WLAR" library files and "WLAE"

                     uppercase "DEC" and "HEX" used to work).
                   [ALL] Value parsers accept now big (32bit) values.
                     Previously only 16bit (and 24bit for 65816) values
                     were accepted.
	           [ALL] ".ende" works now also (only ".ENDE" used to work).
                   [ALL] Added .STRUCT.
                   [ALL] Macro and repeat stacks are now dynamic.
                   [Z80] The linenumber in memory references generated by
                     .SDSCTAG was incorrect.
                   [65x] Fixed a case where operand hinting was ignored.

v8.6 (02-May-2002) [65x] Forgot to add .b/.w operand hint support to
                     pure hexadecimal and binary operands.
                   [65x] Fixed a lot of 8bit relative operands to be absolute.
                   [65x] Added support for 65C02 systems (wla-65c02).
                   [HuC] Added support for HuC6280 systems (wla-huc6280).
                   [Z80] WLALINK would discard (with flag d) all SDSCTAG-
                     sections generated with .SDSCTAG.
                   [Z80] Added few missing Z80 opcodes (eg. "JP (IY)").
                   [Z80] Fixed a silly bug in .SDSCTAG.
                   [SPC] Renamed "wla-spc" to "wla-spc700".

v8.5 (19-Apr-2002) [ALL] All unidentified free strings were treated as labels.
                     Fixed so that labels can only start at the beginning of
                     a new line.
                   [ALL] Added support for yet another un-named label (__).
                   [ALL] ".endm" works now also (only ".ENDM" used to work).
                   [ALL] Fixed the preprocessor to work better.
                   [ALL] Fixed .DxSIN & .DxCOS to finally work properly.
                   [ALL] 'x' switch generates now also WLA_VERSION.
                   [ALL] Fixed the preprocessor to handle few special cases
                      related to the use of '+'.
                   [65x] WLA can now be also hinted about the operand size
                     with .b and .w in the operand (eg. "and 10.w").

v8.4 (24-Dec-2001) [ALL] Token parser could fail while skipping comma
                     separated tokens inside .IF.
                   [ALL] Updated the documentation (few crucial things were
                     missing).
                   [ALL] Fixed .RAMSECTION to work (was missing since its
                     introduction).
                   [ALL] Internal pass 1 failed to see duplicate labels.
                   [ALL] Address labels don't need to end to ':' any more.
                   [ALL] Added support for un-named labels
                     (-, --, +, ++, ...).
                   [ALL] Stack calculator can now return strings (and will
                     if the result consists of only one string).

4... WLALINK History
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


v5.7 (01-Jan-2007) A reference to a non existing anonymous label inside a
                     pending calculation would crash WLALINK.
                   Taking the bank number of an anonymous label inside a
                     pending calculation would return the label's address.
                   128 was the maximum legal distance to an 8bit reference,
                     fixed this to 127. The same range bug was in bank header
                     section calculations as well.

v5.6 (01-Jan-2006) Anonymous labels don't fool the unused section discarder
                     to think that a section is referenced.
                   WLALINK could find anonymous labels that had been
                     inside discarded sections.
                   WLALINK can output WLA symbol files as well (option 'S').
                   Added more safety checks to anonymous label calculations.
                   Symbol file writers handle .BASE correctly.
                   Fixed SMC header writing (by Tobias Pflug).

v5.5 (30-Jul-2004) Added support for hexadecimal input values using the
                     suffix 'h'.

v5.4 (10-May-2004) SUPERFREE sections are now inserted into the output after
                     all FREE and SEMIFREE sections.
                   All sections are sorted by size and placed in the output
                     by starting from the largest section.
                   Added preliminary support for list files.
                   Added support for operators '>' (get the high byte) and
                     '<' (get the low byte).
                   Supported object file format is now "WLAK" and library
                     file format "WLAV".
                   FREE, SEMIFREE and SUPERFREE sections can be aligned.

v5.3 (23-Nov-2003) When finding the match the distances between anonymous
                     labels are now measured using their positions in the
                     output file, not using line numbers in the source files
                     (fixes anonymous labels inside .REPT).
                   Added "CADDR", label for referencing the current address.
                   SMS checksum should now be computed correctly, regardless
                     of the ROM size.
                   Fixed a rare segfault with computation definitions.
                   WLALINK displays better error messages when there is no
                     room for a section.
                   When positioning SUPERFREE sections the only suitable
                     bank candidates are those, which have the same size
                     than the slot of the section.
                   Supported object file format is now "WLAH" and library
                     file format is "WLAT".

v5.2 (06-Jun-2003) Supported object file format is now "WLAG" and library
                     file format is "WLAS".
                   Added support for SNES checksum computing.
                   Added support for SUPERFREE sections.
                   Fixed WLALINK to work with the new SNES/65816 banking
                     selection scheme.
                   Enhanced error messages.

v5.1 (22-Jan-2003) A bug introduced in v5.0 made local labels to fail
                     in some occasions.
                   Added support for longer filenames (> 63 characters).
                   Supported object file format is now "WLAE" and library
                     file format is "WLAR".
                   Object & library file structures weren't initialized
                     completely - could cause a crash if one of the files to
                     be linked was missing.

v5.0 (28-Nov-2002) When discarding unreferenced sections WLALINK will
                     process only FREE and SEMIFREE sections.

v4.9 (28-Apr-2002) When computing SMS ROM checksum WLALINK now writes
                     $4C to $7FFF (32KB checksum, and SMS export).
                   8bit label references are now allowed (zero page labels).

v4.8 (22-Jan-2002) Added support for yet another un-named label (__).

v4.7 (22-Dec-2001) Added support for un-named labels (-, --, +, ++, ...).

v4.6 (31-Aug-2001) It's possible to make value definitions inside the
                     linkfile.

v4.5 (16-Jul-2001) WLALINK wrote SNES ROM info byte into $FFD5 regardless
                     of the ROM mode.
                   Added XOR-operator (~) support to computations.
                   Added support for RAM sections.

v4.4 (30-Jun-2001) For example a reference to ":label_01" will give the
                     label_01's bank number instead of its address.
                   Linkfile's library loader supports now BASE (works
                     like WLA's .BASE).
                   Linkfile parser supports now hexadecimal values.
                   Added support for 16bit relative references.

v4.3 (19-May-2001) Optimized FREE and SEMIFREE section placing.
                   Optimized section data inserting.
                   Supported object file format is now "WLAD" and library
                     file format is "WLAQ".
                   Thanks to WLA simplifications, WLALINK code also
                     experienced small simplifications.
                   OVERWRITE and FORCE sections which overflow from the ROM
                     file don't crash WLALINK any more.
                   Added flag 'd' for unreferenced section discarding.

v4.2 (10-May-2001) Memory overwrite error messages could crash WLALINK
                     (supplied a bad object pointer to message routine).

v4.1 (05-May-2001) A bug was introduced in memory overwrite check
                     optimizations, FREE sections could be written on top
                     of each other.

v4.0 (22-Apr-2001) WLALINK doesn't crash anymore when a modulo/division
                     by zero happens in the stack calculator routines.
                   Added support for 24bit references.
                   Enhanced error messages.

v3.9 (12-Apr-2001) Updated few structures to satisfy the internal changes in
                     the latest WLA.
                   If a FORCE section matches the underlying, written data
                     (other FORCE sections) completely, no error is issued.
                   Added support for unique SECTIONs.

v3.8 (02-Feb-2001) Supported object file format is now "WLAB" for non
                     GB-Z80 systems (adds checksum computing).
                   Due to a typo the bank number of a pending calculation
                     could get corrupted during object file parsing.

v3.7 (08-Oct-2000) Added support for 6510.

v3.6 (07-Oct-2000) Added support for 65816 (24bit values).

v3.4 (09-Sep-2000) Label duplicate checker didn't handle local labels
                     correctly.
                   Added support for modulo in calculations.
                   Added support for SEMIFREE sections.
                   Computations are now computed internally with higher
                     precision when possible and the result is converted to
                     an integer.

v3.3 (04-Sep-2000) Enhanced error messages.
                   Added support for powers and shifts in calculations.
                   Added support for special ROM bank header sections.

                   Optimized label handling.

v3.2 (31-Aug-2000) The supported file formats are only "WLAP", "WLA9" (GB-Z80)
                     and "WLAA" (Z80).
                   Added a fully functional stack calculator engine.
                   Objects with different ROM sizes can be combined, and the
                     result will use the biggest ROM size found as long as
                     the sizes of the ROM banks match.
                   Optimized file parsers.
                   Enhanced error messages.
