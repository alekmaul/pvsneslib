	When enabled, the SNES will read 16 bits from each of the 4 controller port
	data lines into registers $4218-f. This begins between H=32.5 and H=95.5 of
	the first V-Blank scanline, and ends 4224 master cycles later. Register $4212
	bit 0 is set during this time. Specifically, it begins at H=74.5 on the first
	frame, and thereafter some multiple of 256 cycles after the start of the
	previous read that falls within the observed range.

	Reading $4218-f during this time will read back incorrect values. The only
	reliable value is that no buttons pressed will return 0 (however, if buttons
	are pressed 0 could still be returned incorrectly). Presumably reading $4016/7
	or writing $4016 during this time will also screw things up.
